# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #4: React Full-stack Application

### Overview

For your 4th and final project, you will make an application using the Postgres, React, Node, Express stack. ​ Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. 

For this project, you may work solo or in groups up to 4 folks.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which stretch goals to focus on for the remainder of your time.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 3 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application (a user), and two that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Use React as a front-end framework**
* **Build a Node/Express backend using Sequelize and a Postgres database**
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* **Include User Stories** (please use GitHub Projects for this)
* **Include ERDs**
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** 
* **A meaningful test suite**
* **Deploy to AWS and/or GitHub Pages**
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.


### Stretch Goals

* **Use react Native**.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, how to use the app, the approach that was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publicly-accessible **user stories you created**
[How to write a good readme](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)

Most importantly a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is 5-10 minutes in length
* **ALL** group members should speak during the presentation (if applicable)
* Shows off all features of the app
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make
* Shout-outs
* Any bugs
* Future features

### To Submit

* **Create a GitHub issue on the this repo** with a link your Project Repo, and link(s) to where your deployed project.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

# Project Week

#### NOTE: We will be at Capital One Labs Thursday 12/7 - Wednesday 12/13

## Standups
You are required to be present by 10:00am EDT for stand-ups each morning where you will answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday
- What am I trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

**Wednesday, December 13th**<br>
Submit your issue by 10am EDT and present your project.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)? Equally distributed git commits and contributions from each associate?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Functionality__: Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectactions!_
